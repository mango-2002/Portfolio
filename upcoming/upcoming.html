  <p><strong>AI-Powered Fish Freshness Detection</strong></p>

  <p>Fish and seafood are valuable sources of essential nutrients, including protein, vitamins, and minerals, which are important for maintaining good health and well-being. Research has shown that omega-3 fatty acids, abundant in fish like tuna, are crucial for supporting brain and heart health throughout a person’s life (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2023). However, to gain these nutrients, the fish must be fresh. Otherwise, they stop being a health booster and become a health risk. Wholesalers and retailers of fresh fish and seafood prioritize food safety and customer satisfaction, as fish spoil quickly, leading to unpleasant odors and a rapid decline in quality (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2023). Since fish deteriorates so quickly, freshness is a main concern. No one wants to deal with food poisoning when they're simply trying to eat healthy.</p>

  <p>Conventional methods for assessing fish freshness involve visual inspections, such as examining the eyes, gills, and scales, along with checking for any odors (Jayasundara et al., 2023). “In most research conducted on the color changes in the eyes and gills, simple color indices have been used to assess fish freshness” (Lalabadi, Sadeghi, & Mireei, 2020). However, these methods have certain limitations. Visual inspections can be highly subjective, and two people might judge the same fish differently. Some techniques involve destructive testing, where chemical analysis requires a portion of the product to be destroyed, resulting in a loss of nutrients (Jayasundara et al., 2023). These methods can be costly and time-consuming.</p>

  <p>Artificial intelligence and image processing can help make fish freshness detection faster and more reliable. This AI system can analyze images of fish and determine if they are fresh or spoiled based on visual features such as eye clarity, gill color, and overall appearance. Fresh fish typically have clear eyes and red gills, while spoiled fish show cloudy eyes and darkened gills (Lalabadi, Sadeghi, & Mireei, 2020). The system can classify fish into categories such as fresh, moderately fresh, and spoiled. This eliminates human subjectivity and makes inspections more consistent. The Kaggle dataset “Fish Freshness Classification” provides 2,335 labeled images of fish in different states of freshness, making it an ideal dataset for training this AI system.</p>

  <p><strong>AI Ethics and Security Concerns</strong></p>
  <p>                 Protecting confidential information is important to maintaining the reliability of any system using AI. My primary concern regarding AI ethics and security is to ensure my system remains secure and does not reveal any sensitive information. Unauthorized access could allow malicious people to manipulate the AI models, leading to inaccurate fish freshness classifications. This could create significant food safety risks and result in the sale of spoiled fish, potentially damaging consumer health. When developing new technology, it’s important to think about security and privacy right from the start. AI systems need strong security measures to protect them from hackers and prevent sensitive information from being compromised. Right now, AI systems aren’t very unified, and that’s a problem. To fix this, there should be a universal code of ethics to make sure AI is used responsibly and for the good of everyone (Reger, 2021).</p>

  <p><strong>Human vs. AI Decision-Making</strong></p>
  <p>The purpose of AI and its creation was to guide and assist humans in making better decisions. While AI systems are designed to help us make the right choices, errors are not limited to humans alone; AI systems can also make mistakes. Executives have acknowledged that AI systems require human intervention due to instances of unfair or unsatisfactory results. A survey conducted by SAS, Accenture, Applied Intelligence, Intel, and Forbes found that many have had to override AI decisions to make better-informed choices. We are still in a stage where AI requires human input, but this could change in the future (McKendrick & Thurai, 2022). Although my AI system has the potential to identify fish freshness more accurately than humans, continuous monitoring is essential. Relying purely on AI to make decisions is not likely to be in our best interest.</p>

  <p><strong>Privacy and Data Security</strong></p>
  <p>To protect personal privacy and data security in my AI system, I would apply encryption to protect data both at rest and while being transmitted. I would also enforce strict access controls and authentication to ensure only those with permission can access the data. Regular monitoring would be essential to detect any unauthorized access or breaches. Finally, I would keep myself updated on the latest security standards and regulations to maintain the system's security.</p>

  <p><strong>Bias and Discrimination</strong></p>
  <p>To ensure my fish AI system works accurately, I need to make sure the training data is diverse, including various species of fish, different sizes, and environments. By using a wide range of data, the system can learn to recognize fish more accurately and reduce the risk of errors. It's also important to regularly review the training data. While increasing the data samples can be beneficial, adding too much unbalanced or irrelevant data could introduce bias. Therefore, it’s crucial to prioritize the quality of the data over the quantity, carefully selecting and reviewing it before feeding it into the system.</p>

  <p><strong>Regulation and Accountability</strong></p>
  <p>Regulating AI shows similar challenges to those faced when regulating the internet and its vast domain. My Fish Freshness AI system helps consumers make informed decisions about the food they consume, specifically determining whether fish is fresh or not. Since human health is at stake, regulation is extremely important to ensure the system is used responsibly. Common ethical AI practices, such as prioritizing transparency, fairness, and accountability, are crucial to prevent harm in such applications. My business directly impacts consumer health by providing an AI system that detects whether fish is spoiled or fresh. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all relevant regulations and food safety standards are strictly followed. We will implement policies designed to protect consumers and guarantee the accuracy and reliability of the AI system’s freshness detection. </p>
